Calculator
A simple calculator that can perform addition, multiplication, subtraction, and division. It is made with simple HTML and JavaScript. It requires some styling to make it look better and attractive. By adding scientific calculations, it can be enhanced further and potentially placed in an app store.

Future Features
Adding CSS to improve styling and aesthetics.
Implementing complex calculations to handle more advanced mathematical operations.
Adding support for scientific calculations, such as trigonometric functions, logarithms, etc.
Testing the calculator functionality thoroughly to ensure accuracy and reliability.
Test in an Interview
If you're preparing for a technical interview, practicing with a calculator project like this can be beneficial. It allows you to demonstrate your understanding of fundamental programming concepts such as user input handling, arithmetic operations, and possibly more advanced mathematical algorithms for complex calculations.
